				About the Legend
			</h1>
			<p style=color:aliceblue;>
				☛ Subhas Chandra Bose born c. January 23, 1897, Cuttack, Orissa [now Odisha], India—died August 18, 1945, Taipei, Taiwan.<br><br>
				☛ The title "Netaji" for Subhash Chandra Bose was first given to him by Indian soldiers of the Azad Hind Fauj (Indian National Army) during the freedom struggle against British colonial rule in India. The term "Netaji" is a combination of two Hindi words: "neta," meaning leader, and "ji," a term of respect.<br><br>
				☛ January 1897 – 18 August 1945) was an Indian nationalist whose defiance of British authority in India made him a hero among many Indians, but his wartime alliances with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan left a legacy vexed by authoritarianism, anti-Semitism, and military failure.<br><br>
				☛Subhas Bose, aged 24, arrived ashore in India at Bombay on the morning of 16 July 1921 and immediately set about arranging an interview with Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi, aged 51, was the leader of the non-cooperation movement that had taken India by storm the previous year and in a quarter-century would evolve to secure its independence.
				<br><br> ☛ Subhas Chandra Bose believed that the Bhagavad Gita was a great source of inspiration for the struggle against the British.Swami Vivekananda's teachings on universalism, his nationalist thoughts and his emphasis on social service and reform had all inspired Subhas Chandra Bose from his very young days. The fresh interpretation of India's ancient scriptures had appealed immensely to him. Some scholars think that Hindu spirituality formed an essential part of his political and social thought.[138] As historian Leonard Gordon explains "Inner religious explorations continued to be a part of his adult life. This set him apart from the slowly growing number of atheistic socialists and communists who dotted the Indian landscape. <strong>
					
                 <br> <br>"Netaji”</strong> ☛Subhas Chandra Bose, popularly known as Netaji, was an outstanding leader of the Indian freedom movement and a revolutionary par excellence. He effectively took the Indian Freedom Movement beyond the frontiers of India which is perhaps a rare feat in the history of our freedom struggle.
				<br><br> ☛Bose was featured on the stamps in India from 1964, 1993, 1997, 2001, 2016, 2018 and 2021.Bose was also featured in ₹2 coins in 1996 and 1997, ₹75 coin in 2018 and ₹125 coin in 2021.
				<br><br> ☛ Netaji Subhash, a feature documentary film about Bose was released in 1947, it was directed by Chhotubhai Desai.
				<br><br> ☛ Since before the beginning of the World War II, Bose was opposed to the attempts to grant Jewish refugees asylum in India.The great anti-Jewish pogrom called "the Night of Broken Glass" happened on 9 November 1938. In early December, the pro-Hindu Mahasabha journals published articles lending support to German anti-Semitism. This stance brought Hindu Mahasabha into conflict with the Congress which, on 12 December, issued a statement containing references to recent European events. Within the Congress, only Bose opposed this stance of the party.
				<br><br> ☛ In 1927, after being released from prison, Bose became general secretary of the Congress party and worked with Jawaharlal Nehru for independence. In late December 1928, Bose organised the Annual Meeting of the Indian National Congress in Calcutta.[85] His most memorable role was as General officer commanding (GOC) Congress Volunteer Corps.
				<br><br> ☛ In Germany, Bose was attached to the Special Bureau for India under Adam von Trott zu Solz which was responsible for broadcasting on the German-sponsored Azad Hind Radio. <br>
				<br><br> ☛ In 1943, after being disillusioned that Germany could be of any help in gaining India's independence, Bose left for Japan. He travelled with the German submarine U-180 around the Cape of Good Hope to the southeast of Madagascar, where he was transferred to the I-29 for the rest of the journey to Imperial Japan. This was the only civilian transfer between two submarines of two different navies in World War II.
				<br><br> ☛ Subhas Chandra Bose died on 18 August 1945 from third-degree burns after his airplane crashed in Japanese-ruled Formosa (now Taiwan).However, many among his supporters, especially in Bengal, refused at the time, and have refused since, to believe either the fact or the circumstances of his death.
				<br><br> ☛ n 2017, ALTBalaji and BIG Synergy Media, released a 9-episode web series, Bose: Dead/Alive, created by Ekta Kapoor, a dramatised version of the book India's Biggest Cover-up written by Anuj Dhar, which starred Bollywood actor Rajkummar Rao as Subhas Chandra Bose and Anna Ador as Emilie Schenkl. The series was praised by both audience and critics, for its plot, performance and production design.[185]
                In January 2019 Zee Bangla started broadcasting the daily television series <strong>Netaji</strong> .
				<br><br> ☛ A disinfectant, Rivamol [sic], was put over most of his body and then a white ointment was applied and he was bandaged over most of his body. Dr. Yoshimi gave Bose four injections of Vita Camphor and two of Digitamine for his weakened heart. These were given about every 30 minutes. Since his body had lost fluids quickly upon being burnt, he was also given Ringer solution intravenously. A third doctor, Dr. Ishii gave him a blood transfusion. An orderly, Kazuo Mitsui, an army private, was in the room and several nurses were also assisting. Bose still had a clear head which Dr. Yoshimi found remarkable for someone with such severe injuries.
